Here's the detailed explanation of how the buffer gets stored with `write_to_buffer`:\n\nThe `globals.result_buffer` is a variable defined at the global scope level which is used to keep the buffer identifier where the results will be stored. Here's how it is used and manipulated:\n\n1. **Initialization and Usage**:\n    - In the `create_window` function, the result buffer (`globals.result_buffer`) is created or set based on the display mode.\n    - This function determines the window configuration and either creates a floating window or uses split windows modes.\n    - When a new buffer is needed, it is created with `vim.api.nvim_create_buf`, and `globals.result_buffer` is set to this new buffer.\n\n2. **Writing to Buffer**:\n    - The `write_to_buffer` function checks if the `globals.result_buffer` is valid before writing. It then fetches all existing lines from the buffer before appending new content to it.\n\nReplace lines: 154-182\n```lua\nlocal function write_to_buffer(lines)\n    if not globals.result_buffer or not vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid(globals.result_buffer) then\n        return\n    end\n\n    local all_lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(globals.result_buffer, 0, -1, false)\n\n    local last_row = #all_lines\n    local last_row_content = all_lines[last_row]\n    local last_col = string.len(last_row_content)\n\n    local text = table.concat(lines or {}, \"\\n\")\n\n    vim.api.nvim_set_option_value(\"modifiable\", true, { buf = globals.result_buffer })\n    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(\n        globals.result_buffer,\n        last_row - 1,\n        last_col,\n        last_row - 1,\n        last_col,\n        vim.split(text, \"\\n\")\n    )\n    -- Move the cursor to the end of the new lines\n    local new_last_row = last_row + #lines - 1\n    vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(globals.float_win, { new_last_row, 0 })\n\n    vim.api.nvim_set_option_value(\"modifiable\", false, { buf = globals.result_buffer })\nend\n```\n\n**Key Points**:\n- `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text`: This function writes the provided lines into `globals.result_buffer`.\n- `globals.result_buffer`: The buffer identifier where results are stored.\n- The lines to be written to the buffer are concatenated and split as needed before being set in the buffer.\n- The modifiability of the buffer is toggled to ensure the buffer can be written to and then made read-only again.\n\nIn summary, the `globals.result_buffer` is where the content is actually stored, and `write_to_buffer` handles writing the processed content to this buffer, ensuring it's properly formatted and inserted.", "request": "where do buffer get stored with writetobuffer"}]
